# 1st Bank of Greece Datathon 2023 Submission 

## UpGreen

UpGreen is an innovative software solution that utilizes open source data from a variety of trusted sources, including the National Bank of Greece, Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT), Ministry of Finance, and Epoledomiia, to identify properties that are most in need of energy upgrading based on criteria such as age and heating medium, and to estimate the associated costs of improvement.

We are actively promoting UpGreen as a powerful tool for banks to utilize as a lead generator, enabling them to identify and target clients who are most likely to benefit from a green loan, in line with their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) objectives. By focusing on high-potential clients who are committed to sustainability, banks can significantly increase the efficacy of their lending programs, while simultaneously contributing to the critical goal of a more sustainable future.
